# HCRust-Scaffold
Web-based wizard for generating HC-Rust applications scaffold. Please see [holochain](https://holochain.org/) for more information.

**Status:** Pre-Alpha. Early development and testing.

This is a web interface which walks you through the basic steps and approach for building a holochain-based distributed application. 

The web tool enqueues a list of CMD commands for HC-Rust, which upon successfull execution, results in building out the fundamental HC-Rust file system and application framework for you. It will intialize the bridges to other holochain applications, define your zomes, entries, and functions, and essentially develop all the modules, data structures, CRUD, and validation scripts that you specify.  Howevever, please keep in mind that unless your application is extremely simple, you should expect to still need to do some coding to complete your app.  You may also choose to pair this hc-rust application framework with your UI language and framework of choice.
